## What is BLE?
Bluetooth Low Energy is a wireless communication protocol designed for short-range communication with minimal power consumption.

## Key Concepts
- **Advertising**: Devices broadcast their presence and services
- **Scanning**: Listening for advertising packets
- **GATT**: Generic Attribute Profile for data exchange
- **Services**: Collections of related functionality
- **Characteristics**: Data values within services

## BLE Channels
- **37 Data Channels**: Used for connection-based communication
- **3 Advertising Channels**: Used for device discovery (37, 38, 39)

## Scan Modes
- **Active Scanning**: Sends scan requests to get more information
- **Passive Scanning**: Only listens to advertising packets
