ubertooth-btle -U0 -t aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff -c /tmp/pipe &

# Step 2: Start Wireshark
wireshark -k -i /tmp/pipe &

# Step 3: Manually filter for lock packets
# Apply filter: btatt && btl2cap.cid == 0x0004

# Step 4: Manually decode commands
# Right-click → Decode As → BT ATT

# Step 5: Export and analyze offline
# File → Export → CSV

# Step 6: Write custom scripts for analysis
python analyze_lock_commands.py exported.csv
```

**Time Required**: 30-60 minutes
**Expertise Needed**: High

```bash
# Single command captures and analyzes
bluefusion security-audit --device "SmartLock-ABCD" --auto-report

# Results available immediately in web UI
# Vulnerabilities highlighted automatically
```

**Time Required**: 5 minutes
**Expertise Needed**: Low

### Scenario 2: Debugging BLE Connection Issues

#### Traditional Workflow (Android HCI + Wireshark)
```bash
# Step 1: Enable HCI logging on Android
# Manual UI navigation required

# Step 2: Reproduce issue
# Manual testing

# Step 3: Extract log
adb bugreport > bugreport.zip

2. Document UUIDs manually (10-15 min)
3. Use Ubertooth to capture traffic (20-30 min)
4. Import to Wireshark and filter (5-10 min)
5. Manually correlate commands with actions (30-60 min)
6. Write custom scripts for interaction (30-60 min)

**Total Time**: 2-3 hours

## Feature Deep Dives

### GATT Database Reconstruction

#### Wireshark Approach
- Manual inspection of ATT packets
- Need to track handle-UUID mappings
- Error-prone correlation process
- No persistence between captures

#### BlueFusion Approach
```python
# Automatic GATT database building
gatt_db = bluefusion.get_gatt_database("device-address")
print(gatt_db.to_tree())  # Visual hierarchy
gatt_db.export("device-gatt.json")  # Reusable structure
```

### Security Vulnerability Detection

#### Traditional Tools
- Manual inspection for common issues
- Need security expertise
- Time-consuming process
- May miss subtle vulnerabilities

#### BlueFusion
```python
# Automatic security assessment
vulns = bluefusion.security_scan("capture.bf")
for vuln in vulns:
    print(f"{vuln.severity}: {vuln.description}")
    print(f"Evidence: {vuln.packets}")
    print(f"Remediation: {vuln.fix}")
```

### Packet Pattern Analysis

#### Wireshark Statistics
- Basic conversation statistics
- Manual pattern identification
- Limited to predefined metrics

#### BlueFusion Intelligence
```python
# ML-powered pattern detection
patterns = bluefusion.analyze_patterns("capture.bf")
patterns.show_anomalies()  # Unusual behavior
patterns.show_sequences()  # Command flows
patterns.predict_next()    # Anticipate behavior
```

## Migration Guide

### Transitioning from Wireshark

1. **Import Existing Captures**
   ```bash
   bluefusion import --wireshark capture.pcapng
   ```

2. **Convert Display Filters**
   ```bash
   # Wireshark: btatt.opcode == 0x12 && frame.len > 20
   # BlueFusion: 
   bluefusion filter "att.write_request and length > 20"
   ```

3. **Recreate Custom Dissectors**
   ```python
   # BlueFusion plugin API
   @bluefusion.dissector("custom-protocol")
   def parse_custom(packet):
       return CustomProtocol.parse(packet.payload)
   ```

### Enhancing Ubertooth Workflows

1. **Direct Integration**
   ```bash
   # Use Ubertooth through BlueFusion
   bluefusion capture --interface ubertooth --enhance
   ```

2. **Automated Following**
   ```bash
   # BlueFusion handles channel hopping
   bluefusion follow --device "target" --adaptive
   ```
