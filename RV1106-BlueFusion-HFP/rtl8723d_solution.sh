echo "✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:"
echo "- Device responds at 1500000 baud (not 115200)"
echo "- UART /dev/ttyS5 is functional"
echo "- Firmware present at /lib/firmware/rtlbt/"
echo "- Chip receives HCI commands (RX bytes: 2775)"
echo ""
echo "❌ ISSUE:"
echo "- MAC address stays 00:00:00:00:00:00"

echo "This will:"
echo "1. Load RTL8723D firmware"
echo "2. Set proper MAC address"
echo "3. Enable full HFP/A2DP functionality"
