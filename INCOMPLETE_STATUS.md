# Current Status: Partially Solved

## What We Successfully Did:
1. ✅ Compiled rtk_hciattach for ARM using GitHub Codespaces
2. ✅ Deployed to RV1106 device
3. ✅ Initialized RTL8723D hardware
4. ✅ Loaded firmware successfully
5. ✅ Got valid MAC address (34:75:63:40:51:3D)

## What's Still Broken:
1. ❌ HCI0 interface won't come UP (Error 132)
2. ❌ BlueALSA can't start ("Network is down")
3. ❌ No Bluetooth connectivity
4. ❓ HFP disconnection issue untested

## Why It's Not "Completely Solved":
- We fixed the **hardware initialization** problem
- But we haven't proven the **HFP disconnection** problem is solved
- Can't test HFP without a working Bluetooth interface

## Next Steps Needed:
1. Debug why HCI0 won't come up after initialization
2. Check kernel logs: `dmesg | grep -i bluetooth`
3. Verify BlueZ is properly installed
4. May need to modify device tree or kernel config
5. Once interface is up, test actual HFP phone calls

## The Real Achievement:
We successfully cross-compiled and deployed the critical rtk_hciattach tool from macOS to ARM, proving the development workflow. The hardware responds correctly, but system integration issues remain.
